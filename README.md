# Contributors
[@bonezone2001](https://github.com/bonezone2001) helped out with a large majority of the coding. If it wasn't for him, this project wouldn't be even close to a completed state.

[@Krzmbrzl](https://github.com/Krzmbrzl) and [@davidebeatrici](https://github.com/davidebeatrici) are Mumble contributors that were both a massive help in the plugin creation process. Specifically, Krzmbrzl created the new plugin framework used in this plugin and wrote the documentation for it, and davidebeatrici was very helpful in answering my C++ noob questions.
